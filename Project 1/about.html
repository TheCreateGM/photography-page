                        Web design is the process of creating visually
                        appealing, user-friendly, and functional websites. It
                        involves a combination of graphic design, user
                        experience (UX) principles, and coding to develop
                        layouts, typography, color schemes, and interactive
                        elements. A well-designed website enhances user
                        engagement, ensures easy navigation, and provides a
                        seamless experience across different devices.
